<!-- NOTES -->

There is an issue with the .get inside of wixClientServer.ts where i am getting an error on route "/" in used cookies().get("refreshToken)
can be overlooked but just in case here are some possible solutions 
Validate the Cookie: Add explicit validation to ensure the refreshToken is a non-empty string and properly formatted.

javascript
Copy code
try {
    const cookie = cookieStore.get("refreshToken");
    refreshToken = cookie && cookie.value ? JSON.parse(cookie.value) : {};
    if (!refreshToken || typeof refreshToken !== "object") {
        throw new Error("Invalid refreshToken format");
    }
} catch (e) {
    console.error("Error handling refreshToken:", e);
    refreshToken = {};
}
If refreshToken is optional: You can overlook the issue since the code gracefully handles missing or malformed cookies by defaulting to an empty object.

If refreshToken is critical: You cannot overlook this. You must ensure:
The "refreshToken" cookie exists and contains valid JSON.

Appropriate error handling is in place to alert users or developers when itâ€™s missing or invalid.
